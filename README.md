# Solubility Prediction 
The study used a dataset of 2000 compounds including 17 features and experimental solubility to create a predictive model for estimating molecular solubility. The dataset was divided into two sets, a training set and a testing set, with a 7:3 ratio. The training set was then cross-validated to find the best parameters for three different regression models: Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression, and Random Forest (RF) Regression. The cross-validation was also used to measure the model's uncertainty. Finally, each optimized model was used to predict solubility on the testing set. The RF Regression model performed the best, with an R-squared score of 0.66, outperforming the MLR and KNN Regression models, which scored 0.32 and 0.58, respectively.
